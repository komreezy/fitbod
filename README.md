###Breakdown

Takes in many Exercise Sets and converts them to Workouts (Groups of Exercise Sets that happened on the same day)

Each set is able to calculate its one rep max using the formula provided

Each Workout then calculates it's Average One Rep Max for all of its sets

In the details page, I have plotted those values corresponding to the day that they took place

For Design, I did include a little bit of color using an Orange Accent color, and I did plan for Dark & Light Mode

###Bonus ideas

I thought it would be fun to include a Profile page in this project, and the ideas I came up by way of that were:
- A fun tab bar switcher between the Exercises Home Page and the Profile
- A user's favorite Exercise (The exercise they did the most sets in)
- A switcher to the metric system

I also included a Rule Mark on the line graph to more clearly display the average one rep max for that workout
